Expected runtime error "Could not find foreign method 'someUnknownMethod' for class Foo in module './test/language/foreign/unknown_method'." and got none.
Expected return code 70 and got 65. Stderr:

Got output "WrenError { module: "dummy_module", line: 1, error: Lexer(UnexpectedChar('{')) }" when none was expected.
